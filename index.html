                Introducing
                <span>ECHOES</span>,
                <br>
                An NPC social network <br>Unity plugin
        </div>
        <p>
            Simply add complex social interactions between the player and npcs in your Unity project. After an interaction with a npc, they will <b>talk</b> about the player to their <b>contacts</b> and influence their <b>opinion</b> of the player. Future interactions may be impacted by the player's <b>reputation</b>, even with npcs they never talked to.
        </p>

        <p>Echoes allows to easily create complex social networks giving a more organic feeling to npc interactions.
            A menu in the inspector allows to visualize the network and access individual npc's settings. Each can belong to a faction, have a bunch of contacts and personality traits.
            Those traits influence their opinion of the player, as rumors spread about them.
            Prove to a NPC that the rumors they have heard are wrong, and they will stop trusting the person that spoke wrongly of you.
